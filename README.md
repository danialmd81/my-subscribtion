## To Do

- [x] Refactor the Telegram `mixed.txt` file: Separate and categorize each protocol (e.g., VMess, VLESS, etc.) into their own dedicated files for better organization and clarity.
- [x] Improve categorization logic: Enhance the process for identifying and sorting protocols in Telegram files to ensure each protocol is clearly distinguished and easy to find.
